# distrox

A distributed social network build on IPFS/IPLD.

## Roadmap

This is the roadmap from the current state to a MVP/POC.
These "features" are not necessarily ordered, but may depend on another.

* Gossipping via gossipsub instead of pubsub
* Profile discovery via gossipsub
* Profile caching
* Profile following
* Multi-device support via raft concensus over gossipsub
* (CLI) cache node functionality ("multi device" node that only caches posts of
  a profile)
* (GUI) Timeline polishing
* (GUI) Markdown support in Text posts
* (GUI) Non-Text posts: Directories (MVP for image/video/audio posts)
